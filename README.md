# StarredRepoChallenge

This aplication gets some data regarding to the most starred repositories of swift from gitHub.

The app shows the results in a tableView with custon cells with the repo name, # of stars and also the avatar picture.

It is possible to pull to refresh the data.

I am still implementing the unit tests
